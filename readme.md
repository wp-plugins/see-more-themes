### License

This plugin, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL. Do what you want with it. I seriously don't care. 

### Developer
---

I'm Sean. I created the [Volatyl Framework](http://volatylthemes.com) for WordPress. I like to do most of my WordPress stuff on [Build WordPress Yourself](http://buildwpyourself.com/). I also write stuff on my [personal site](http://seandavis.co) and [SDavis Media](http://sdavismedia.com). Follow me on the [Twitter](http://sdvs.me/twitter) machine.

Meanwhile, tell me... is this plugin useful to you? If so, consider buying me a box of "Tazo: Awake - English Breakfast Black Tea." I need ALL the energiez. Thanks. [Donate Black Tea](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=52HQDSEUA542S)
